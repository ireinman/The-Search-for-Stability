# Code for The Search for Stability: Learning Dynamics of Strategic Publishers with Initial Documents

## Getting Started

First, make sure you are located in the `code` directory:

```
code
├── README.md
├── animation.ipynb
|── extra_simulations.ipynb
├── k_effect_direct_analysis.ipynb
├── k_effect_prp_converage_ratio.ipynb
├── main_simulations.ipynb
├── periodicity_static.ipynb
├── regularity_probability.ipynb
├── requirements.txt
├── figures
├── results
├── utils
```

Next, use `pip` to install project requirements:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Notebooks

Now, you may launch the JupyterLab interface by running the `jupyter lab` command, and interact with each of the following notebooks:

- `main_simulations.ipynb`: ranking functions and hyperparameter comparisons for Sections 6.2 and 6.3.
- `periodicity_static.ipynb`: visualizing the periodic nature of the PRP dynamics for Section 6.4.
- `regularity_probability.ipynb`: calculations of probability of regularity condition for Appendix B.
- `k_effect_direct_analysis.ipynb`: direct simulations for Appendix C.
- `k_effect_prp_converage_ratio.ipynb`: PRP convergence simulations for Appendix C.
- `extra_simulations.ipynb`: additional simulations for Appendix D.
- `animation.ipynb`: This interactive notebook enables animating the learning dynamics of different ranking functions and different game parameters, and me mentioned in Section 6.4.

## Additional Directories

The `utils` directory contains the source code for the notebooks. <br>
The `figures` directory contains the figures generated by the notebooks. <br>
The `results` directory contains the numerical results of simulations generated by the notebooks.
